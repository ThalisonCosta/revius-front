# Production Build Verification

This document confirms that the Revius frontend is properly configured for production deployment without development tools.

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Development Tools Removal
- **ReactQueryDevtools**: Now conditionally loaded only in development mode
- **Dynamic Import**: Uses Next.js dynamic imports to exclude from production bundle
- **Environment Check**: `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` condition applied
- **Webpack Alias**: Production builds exclude `@tanstack/react-query-devtools` entirely

### 2. Production Optimizations
- **Console Removal**: All console.log statements removed in production
- **React Properties**: Development-only React properties stripped
- **Source Maps**: Disabled for production builds
- **Compression**: Enabled for better performance
- **Security Headers**: Added production security headers

### 3. Bundle Configuration
- **PWA**: Service worker properly configured for production
- **Image Optimization**: Enhanced for entertainment content (posters, covers)
- **Tree Shaking**: Development dependencies excluded from production bundle

## 🧪 Testing Results
